# cspro_form34

This repository includes:
- Logic scripts in CSPro for digitalizing Form 34s (Kenya's 2013 Presidential election results at polling station level)
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual "codebook" for CSPro outputs
- R script and results of inter-rater reliability tests (needs to be pushed)





Note to self: If changes are made to the logic scripts and applied to CSPro, synchronization between the coders and the Dropbox account has to be set up again.
